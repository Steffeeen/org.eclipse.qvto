This folder is a placeholder for the QVTo example project ZIPs

For a Tycho build, the ZIPs are built by a pre_build.xml invocation from maven-antrun in pom.xml.

For interactive Eclipse usage, the pre_build.xml may be run as Run->External Tools->QVTo Example ZIPs.
The QVTo Example ZIPs should run automatically when the project is built.
